By analyzing a mapping from the involved Sobolev space to the IFE space, this article is able to extend the scaling argument framework to the error estimation for the approximation capability of a class of IFE spaces in one spatial dimension. As demonstrations of the versatility of this unified error analysis framework, the manuscript applies the proposed scaling argument to obtain optimal IFE error estimates for a typical first-order linear hyperbolic interface problem, a second-order elliptic interface problem, and the fourth-order Euler-Bernoulli beam interface problem, respectively.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A unified immersed finite element error analysis for one-dimensional interface problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slimane Adjerid","Tao Lin","Haroun Meghaichi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"176fe051cdd7e3bd9782321586629b99","permalink":"https://hmegh.github.io/publication/acoustic-elastic/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acoustic-elastic/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an immersed discontinuous Galerkin (IDG) method for interface problems simulating wave propagation in acoustic-elastic media. The method uses an interface independent mesh that allows elements to be cut by the material interface and thus leading to elements consisting of the union of an acoustic medium and an elastic medium. In this method, two different wave propagation models are treated in each interface element where piecewise polynomials constructed according to interface jump conditions are to be used. The proposed discontinuous Galerkin method is stable. We present several computational examples and results to illustrate the stability, efficacy and accuracy of the method.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An immersed discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in acoustic elastic media","type":"publication"}]
