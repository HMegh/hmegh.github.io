The IFE functions developed here satisfy the interface conditions strongly and they have optimal approximation capabilities. The construction of this novel IFE space relies on a nonlinear transformation based on the Frenet-Serret frame of the interface to locally map it into a line segment, and this feature makes the process of constructing the IFE functions cost-effective and robust for any degree. This new class of immersed finite element functions is locally conforming with usual weak form of the interface problem so that they can be employed in the standard symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin scheme without additional penalties on the interface. Numerical examples are provided to showcase the convergence properties of the method under $h$ and $p$ refinements.","tags":null,"title":"A High Order  Geometry Conforming Immersed Finite Element for  Elliptic Interface Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slimane Adjerid","Tao Lin","Haroun Meghaichi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"e69710ba00a545785f54d4a5caf5546c","permalink":"https://hmegh.github.io/publication/1d-analysis/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1d-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"It has been noted that the traditional scaling argument cannot be directly applied to the error analysis of immersed finite elements (IFE) because, in general, the spaces on the reference element associated with the IFE spaces on different interface elements via the standard affine mapping are not the same. By analyzing a mapping from the involved Sobolev space to the IFE space, this article is able to extend the scaling argument framework to the error estimation for the approximation capability of a class of IFE spaces in one spatial dimension. As demonstrations of the versatility of this unified error analysis framework, the manuscript applies the proposed scaling argument to obtain optimal IFE error estimates for a typical first-order linear hyperbolic interface problem, a second-order elliptic interface problem, and the fourth-order Euler-Bernoulli beam interface problem, respectively.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A unified immersed finite element error analysis for one-dimensional interface problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slimane Adjerid","Tao Lin","Haroun Meghaichi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"176fe051cdd7e3bd9782321586629b99","permalink":"https://hmegh.github.io/publication/acoustic-elastic/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acoustic-elastic/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an immersed discontinuous Galerkin (IDG) method for interface problems simulating wave propagation in acoustic-elastic media. The method uses an interface independent mesh that allows elements to be cut by the material interface and thus leading to elements consisting of the union of an acoustic medium and an elastic medium. In this method, two different wave propagation models are treated in each interface element where piecewise polynomials constructed according to interface jump conditions are to be used. The proposed discontinuous Galerkin method is stable. We present several computational examples and results to illustrate the stability, efficacy and accuracy of the method.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An immersed discontinuous Galerkin method for wave propagation in acoustic elastic media","type":"publication"}]
