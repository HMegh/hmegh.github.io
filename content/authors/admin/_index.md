<!-- I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Virginia Tech, -->
I am currently a Ross Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University. I obtained my PhD at Virginia Tech under the supervision of [Dr. Slimane Adjerid](https://math.vt.edu/people/faculty/adjerid-slimane.html) and [Dr. Tao Lin](https://math.vt.edu/people/faculty/lin-tao.html). 


 My research in numerical analysis of PDEs and scientific computing. In particular, in the finite element method and the discontinuous Galerkin method.
