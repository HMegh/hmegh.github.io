I am a firm believer in [Federico Ardila's axioms](https://fardila.com/):

- Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
